[-] Build CmdStan.
	REF [file] >> ${GDT_HOME}/sw_dev/cpp/rnd/src/statistics/stan_usage_guide.txt

[-] Usage (Windows).
	- Download MatlabStan & MatlabProcessManager.
	- Add CmdStan path.
		In ${MatlabStan_HOME}/+mstan/stan_home.m
			d = 'D:\lib_repo\cpp\rnd\cmdstan_github';

	- If CmdStan is compiled by MinGW.
		Open Command Prompt.
		Set path to MinGW.
			set path=${MinGW_HOME}/bin;%path%
		Run Matlab in Command Prompt.

	- Add MatlabStan in Matlab.
		addpath('${MatlabProcessManager_HOME}');
		addpath('${MatlabStan_HOME}');

	- For fitting Stan models.
		Delete related files.
			e.g.) When a file name is eight_schools.stan,
				Delete eight_schools.exe & eight_schools.hpp
		Do stan(...).
