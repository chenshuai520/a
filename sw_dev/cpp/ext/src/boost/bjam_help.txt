Usage:

  bjam [options] [install|stage]

  Builds and installs Boost.

Targets and Related Options:

  install                 Install headers and compiled library files to the
  =======                 configured locations (below).

  --prefix=<PREFIX>       Install architecture independent files here.
                          Default; C:\Boost on Win32
                          Default; /usr/local on Unix. Linux, etc.

  --exec-prefix=<EPREFIX> Install architecture dependent files here.
                          Default; <PREFIX>

  --libdir=<DIR>          Install library files here.
                          Default; <EPREFIX>/lib

  --includedir=<HDRDIR>   Install header files here.
                          Default; <PREFIX>/include

  stage                   Build and install only compiled library files
  =====                   to the stage directory.

  --stagedir=<STAGEDIR>   Install library files here
                          Default; ./stage

Other Options:

  --build-type=<type>     Build the specified pre-defined set of variations
                          of the libraries. Note, that which variants get
                          built depends on what each library supports.

                              minimal (default) - Builds the single
                              "release" version of the libraries. This
                              release corresponds to specifying:
                              "release <threading>multi <link>shared
                              <runtime-link>shared" as the Boost.Build
                              variant to build.

                              complete - Attempts to build all possible
                              variations.

  --build-dir=DIR         Build in this location instead of building
                          within the distribution tree. Recommended!

  --toolset=toolset       Indicates the toolset to build with.

  --show-libraries        Displays the list of Boost libraries that require
                          build and installation steps, then exit.

  --layout=<layout>       Determines whether to choose library names 
                          and header locations such that multiple 
                          versions of Boost or multiple compilers can
                          be used on the same system.

                              versioned (default) - Names of boost
                              binaries include the Boost version
                              number and the name and version of the
                              compiler.  Boost headers are installed
                              in a subdirectory of <HDRDIR> whose
                              name contains the Boost version
                              number.

                              system - Binaries names do not include
                              the Boost version number or the name
                              and version number of the compiler.
                              Boost headers are installed directly
                              into <HDRDIR>.  This option is
                              intended for system integrators who
                              are building distribution packages.

  --buildid=ID            Adds the specified ID to the name of built
                          libraries.  The default is to not add anything.

  --help                  This message.

  --with-<library>        Build and install the specified <library>
                          If this option is used, only libraries
                          specified using this option will be built.

  --without-<library>     Do not build, stage, or install the specified
                          <library>. By default, all libraries are built.

 This file is used to configure your Boost.Build installation.
 You can modify this file in place, or you can place it it
 permanent location so that it's not overwritten should you
 get new version of Boost.Build. See:

   http://boost.org/boost-build2/doc/html/bbv2/reference.html#bbv2.reference.init

 for documentation about permanent location.
