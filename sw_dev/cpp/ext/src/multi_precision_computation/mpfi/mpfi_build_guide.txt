<<주의>> static library로 build 됨.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

[1] build static library in Cygwin & MinGW
	run "Cygwin Bash" or "MSYS"
	cd ${mpfi_build}
	./configure --prefix=${mpfi_install} --with-mpfr-include=${mpfr_install}/include --with-mpfr-lib=${mpfr_install}/lib --with-gmp-include=${gmp_install}/include --with-gmp-lib=${gmp_install}/lib
	make
	(optional) make check
	(optional) make install

[2] build shared library in Cygwin & MinGW
	1. build shared library
		run "Cygwin Bash" or "MSYS"
		cd ${mpfi_build}
		./configure --prefix=${mpfi_install} --with-mpfr-include=${mpfr_install}/include --with-mpfr-lib=${mpfr_install}/lib --with-gmp-include=${gmp_install}/include --with-gmp-lib=${gmp_install}/lib --disable-static --enable-shared
		make
		(optional) make check
		(optional) make install

		a windows DLL "cygmpfi-1.dll" (Cygwin) or "libmpfi-1.dll" (MinGW) will be generated.

	2. to ensure that these DLLs can be called by a Microsoft Visual C++ program
		you must generate an import library (.lib) for them.

		if you have an existing DLL already, you need to build a Cygwin-compatible import library.

		(1) if there is no def file in ${mpfi_build}/src/.libs, generate def file
			cd ${mpfi_build}/src/.libs or ${mpfi_install}/bin
			echo EXPORTS > ${mpfi_lib_name}.dll.def
			nm ${mpfi_lib_name}.dll | grep ' T _' | sed 's/.* T _//' >> ${mpfi_lib_name}.dll.def

			where ${mpfi_lib_name} means cygmpfi-1 (Cygwin) or libmpfi-1 (MinGW)

			Note that this will only work if the DLL is not stripped.
			Otherwise you will get an error message: "No symbols in ${mpfi_lib_name}.dll".

		(2) once you have the ${mpfi_lib_name}.dll.def file, you can create an import library from it like this.

			(주의) dll file과 def file의 이름이 다르다면 def file의 이름과 형식에 맞추어 dll file과 lib file의 이름을 정해야 한다. (확인 필요)
				e.g.) libmpfi-10.dll & libmpfi-1.dll.def ==> libmpfi-1.dll.dll & libmpfi-1.dll.def

			cd ${mpfi_build}/src/.libs
			mv ${mpfi_lib_name}.dll ${mpfi_lib_name}.dll.dll
			(a) using dlltool in Cygwin & MinGW
				dlltool --def ${mpfi_lib_name}.dll.def --dllname ${mpfi_lib_name}.dll.dll --output-lib ${mpfi_lib_name}.dll.lib
			(b) using Microsoft LIB tool
				lib /machine:i386 /def:${mpfi_lib_name}.dll.def /out:${mpfi_lib_name}.dll.lib

		(3) (optional) in Cygwin & MinGW
			removes unnecessary information from executable binary programs and object files,
			thus potentially resulting in better performance and sometimes significantly less disk space usage.

			strip ${mpfi_lib_name}.lib
