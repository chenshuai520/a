[1] build static library in Cygwin & MinGW
	run "Cygwin Bash" or "MSYS"
	cd ${gmp_build}
	./configure --prefix=${gmp_install}
	make
	(optional) make check
	make install

[2] build shared library in Cygwin & MinGW
	1. build shared library
		run "Cygwin Bash" or "MSYS"
		cd ${gmp_build}
		./configure --prefix=${gmp_install} --disable-static --enable-shared
		make
		(optional) make check
		make install

		a windows DLL "cyggmp-3.dll" (Cygwin) or "libgmp-3.dll" (MinGW) will be generated.

	2. to ensure that these DLLs can be called by a Microsoft Visual C++ program
		you must generate an import library (.lib) for them.

		if you have an existing DLL already, you need to build a Cygwin-compatible import library.

		(1) if there is no def file in ${gmp_build}/.libs, generate def file
			cd ${gmp_build}/.libs or ${gmp_install}/bin
			echo EXPORTS > ${gmp_lib_name}.def
			nm ${gmp_lib_name}.dll | grep ' T _' | sed 's/.* T _//' >> ${gmp_lib_name}.def

			where ${gmp_lib_name} means cyggmp-3 (Cygwin) or libgmp-3 (MinGW)

			Note that this will only work if the DLL is not stripped.
			Otherwise you will get an error message: "No symbols in ${gmp_lib_name}.dll".

		(2) once you have the ${gmp_lib_name}.dll.def file, you can create an import library from it like this.

			(주의) dll file과 def file의 이름이 다르다면 def file의 이름과 형식에 맞추어 dll file과 lib file의 이름을 정해야 한다.
				e.g.) libgmp-10.dll & libgmp-3.dll.def ==> libgmp-3.dll.dll & libgmp-3.dll.def

			cd ${gmp_build}/.libs
			mv ${gmp_lib_name}.dll ${gmp_lib_name}.dll.dll
			(a) using dlltool in Cygwin & MinGW
				dlltool --def ${gmp_lib_name}.dll.def --dllname ${gmp_lib_name}.dll.dll --output-lib ${gmp_lib_name}.dll.lib
			(b) using Microsoft LIB tool
				lib /machine:i386 /def:${gmp_lib_name}.dll.def /out:${gmp_lib_name}.dll.lib

		(3) (optional) in Cygwin & MinGW
			removes unnecessary information from executable binary programs and object files,
			thus potentially resulting in better performance and sometimes significantly less disk space usage.

			strip ${gmp_lib_name}.lib

[1] Cygwin & MinGW (Building static GMP library)
Cygwin
	Download latest GMP from GNU MP to ${gmp_download}. 
	Run "Cygwin Bash", unzip and untar GMP into ${gmp_build} using following command: 
		cd ${gmp_build}
		tar xzvf ${gmp_download}/gmp-x.x.x.tar.gz
	Configure GMP for compilation: 
		cd gmp-x.x.x
		./configure --prefix=${gmp_install}
	Build GMP: 
		make
	Install GMP header files and lib files: 
	make install

MinGW
	Download latest GMP from GNU MP to ${gmp_download}. 
	Run "MSYS", unzip and untar GMP into ${gmp_build} using following command: 
		cd ${gmp_build}
		tar xzvf ${gmp_download}/gmp-x.x.x.tar.gz
	Configure GMP for compilation: 
		cd gmp-x.x.x
		./configure --prefix=${gmp_install}
	Build GMP: 
		make
	Install GMP header files and lib files: 
		make install

For those who would like to use the Cygwin environment for development MinGW, you can follow these steps: 
	(For MinGW 2.0 earlier only) Rename MinGW's "make.exe" (${mingw}/bin/make.exe) to "mingw32-make.exe". 
	Add ${mingw}/bin at the beginning of the environment variable PATH. 
		export PATH=${mingw}/bin:$PATH (for bash, sh)
		or
		setenv PATH ${mingw}/bin:$PATH (for csh, tcsh)
	Download latest GMP from GNU MP to ${gmp_download}. 
	Run "Cygwin Bash", unzip and untar GMP into ${gmp_build} using following command: 
		cd ${gmp_build}
		tar xzvf ${gmp_download}/gmp-x.x.x.tar.gz
	Modify the "configure" script in GMP, change these lines (toward the end) 
		# Make a symlink if possible; otherwise try a hard link.
		ln -s $ac_rel_source $ac_dest 2>/dev/null || ln $srcdir/$ac_source $ac_dest ||
		to
		# Make a symlink if possible; otherwise try a hard link.
		#ln -s $ac_rel_source $ac_dest 2>/dev/null || ln $srcdir/$ac_source $ac_dest ||
		(Add a comment on first "ln -s" so hard link are created instead of symbolic link) 
	Configure GMP for compilation: 
		cd gmp-x.x.x
		./configure --build=pentium3-pc-mingw32 --prefix=${gmp_install}
		(replace "pentium3-pc" by your CPU type) 
	Build GMP: 
		make
	Install GMP header files and lib files: 
		make install

[2] Cygwin & MinGW (Building dynamic GMP library)
	GMP cannot build static and shared libraries at the same time and it will only build static library by default.
	To use dynamic library, i.e DLL under windows platform, you need to add the options "--disable-static --enable-shared" when you configure GMP, i.e. run this command: 
		./configure --prefix=${gmp_install} --disable-static --enable-shared
	A windows DLL "cyggmp-3.dll" (Cygwin) or "libgmp-3.dll" (MinGW) will be generated and you can link it with your executable programs as usual under Cygwin & MinGW
	except that when you run them, you have put these DLLs in some path which is listed in environment variable $PATH.
	To ensure that these DLLs can be called by a Microsoft Visual C++ program,
	you must generate an import library (.lib) for them, using Microsoft LIB tool: 
		cd gmp-x.x.x/.libs
		lib /machine:i386 /def:cyggmp-3.dll-def (for Cygwin) 
		or
		lib /machine:i386 /def:libgmp-3.dll-def (for MinGW)
