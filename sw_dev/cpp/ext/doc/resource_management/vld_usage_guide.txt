[-] Execution Setting.
	- vld configuration file has to exist in the same directory with an executable file.
		configuration file: vld.ini
		If it does not already exist, default settings are applied.
	- Need the file below to run.
		vld_x86.dll/lib vld.lib
		vld_x64.dll/lib vld.lib
		dbghelp.dll
		Microsoft.DTfW.DHL.manifest
			manifest file of dbghelp.dll.
		==> Might as well use VLD library of debug build.

[-] Usage.
	- vld.h has to be included in a file of library or executable project. (?)
	- When an executable terminates normally, the VLD's results are generated.
	- Only detect memory leakage on the execution path.

[-] Trouble Shooting (VC).
	- The application was unable to start correctly in the debug mode.
		<error>
			The application was unable to start correctly (0xc0150002)
		<solution #1>
			Need dbghelp.dll to use vld library.
			Must use dbghelp.dll which is distributed together with source.
				${VLD_HOME}/setup/dbghelp/x86/dbghelp.dll
				${VLD_HOME}/setup/dbghelp/x64/dbghelp.dll
		<solution #2>
			Comment the following line on vld.h
			<before>
				#pragma comment(linker, "/include:__imp_?g_vld@@3VVisualLeakDetector@@A")
			<after>
				//#pragma comment(linker, "/include:__imp_?g_vld@@3VVisualLeakDetector@@A")
		REF [site] >> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19216358/the-application-was-unable-to-start-correctly-after-including-vld-h
	- Many errors occur in executable projects.
		<solution>
			Build the projects below.
				libformat & vld projects.
	- Cannot find Windows.h, SDKDDKVer.h, kernel32.lib, and rc.exe.
		<error>
			cannot open include file: 'windows.h'
			cannot open file 'kernel32.lib'
			cannot run 'rc.exe'
		<solution>
			Set a correct platform toolset in Project Property Pages.
				Project Property Pages -> Configuration Properties -> General -> Platform Toolset
			Can use the methods below.
				Add "$(WindowsSDKDir)/Include" to additional include directories.
				Add "$(WindowsSDKDir)/Lib" to additional library dependencies.
				Add "$(WindowsSDKDir)/Bin" to PATH environment variable.
