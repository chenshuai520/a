[-] Usage.
	- PyCaffe.
		Support Python 2.

		Set PYTHONPATH to ${CAFFE_HOME}/python.
			export PYTHONPATH=${CAFFE_HOME}/python:$PYTHONPATH
		'python2-numpy' has to be installed from 'apt-get' rather than from 'pip2'.

[-] Building (CMake).
	- The name of a build directory for CMake has to be "build". (?)
		The existing scripts in Caffe assume its build directory is "build".

	- Configure & generate.
		Set CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX to d.
		Set USE_LEVELDB to false.
		Set USE_LMDB to false.
		Set BUILD_python to false.
		Set BUILD_python_layer to false.
	- Build.
		Build errors occurred. Build cannot be succeeded in VC.
	- Install.

[-] Trouble shooting.
	- PyCaffe import error.
		<error>
			dynamic module does not define module export function (PyInit__caffe)
		<solution>
			Set PYTHONPATH to ${CAFFE_HOME}/python.
			'python2-numpy' has to be installed from 'apt-get' rather than from 'pip2'.
			'_caffe.so' exists in the '${CAFFE_HOME}/python/caffe' folder.
