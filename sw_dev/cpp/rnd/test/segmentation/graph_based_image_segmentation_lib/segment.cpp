The program takes a color image (PPM format) and produces a segmentation
with a random color assigned to each region.

run "segment sigma k min input output".

The parameters are: (see the paper for details)

sigma: Used to smooth the input image before segmenting it.
k: Value for the threshold function.
min: Minimum component size enforced by post-processing.
input: Input image.
output: Output image.
